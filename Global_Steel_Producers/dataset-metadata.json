  "title": "Top 100 Global Steel Producers (2011-2016)",
  "subtitle": "Steel is being produced on a global level in places that might surprise you",
  "description": "### Context\n\nThe production of steel has shifted from a just few primary countries to many countries all over the world. This dataset provides statistics and insight into the locations and volumes of steel production for years 2011-2016 with specific ranking in 2015 and 2016.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe data source is worldsteel Association. www.worldsteel.org\n\n### Inspiration\n\nSome questions are trends, predictive analytics/forecasting/consolidation possibilities and global supply chain. While the steel industry is 'flat' where steel is produced and shipped globally. There may an opportunity for a new model where steel is increasingly produced locally to save shipping and logistics costs.",
